# Build your first HTML5 Game

Welcome to the HTML5 Game Development Activity.
In this step-by-step tutorial we create a simple mobile MDN Breakout game written in JavaScript and using the Phaser framework. Every step has editable, live samples available to play with so you can see what the intermediate stages should look like. You will learn the basics of using the Phaser framework to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, control machanisms, framework-specific helper functions, animations and tweens, and winning and losing states.

Now that you forked this repository you can start learning how to build your own HTML5 Game and customize it based on your preference.

<b>Clone this repository</b> into your computer and start building your first HTML5 Game by opening the "index.html" file from your browser.
