<h1>HTML 5 Game Development</h1>
<h2>Article 12: Win the game</h2>

<p>Implementing winning in our game is quite easy: if you happen to destroy all the bricks, then you win:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">
function ballHitBrick(ball, brick) {
    brick.kill();
    score += 10;
    scoreText.setText('Points: '+score);
    if(score === brickInfo.count.row*brickInfo.count.col*10) {
        alert('You won the game, congratulations!');
        location.reload();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>If your score is the same as the number of bricks initially available on the screen - times 10 as you score 10 points instead of 1 for every brick - then show the proper message.</p>

<h2 id="Next_steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>Both losing and winning is already implemented, so the core gameplay of our game is finished. Now we can add something extra, like three <a href="article13.html">lives</a> instead of one.</p>
